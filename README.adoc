# Boolf interpreter

This is a Boolf interpreter that I wrote for fun. Boof is a derivative of the Turing tarpit esoteric programming language Brainf designed around bit manipulating instead of whole integers.

The Boof language is described here: http://samuelhughes.com/boof/

To compile the program, just run `make`.

Multiple examples are provided with this distribution and may be passed to the interpreter like so:

	./boof examples/hello.boof

When no input name is given, the interpreter will read until the first end of file indicator, then continue reading for data.
