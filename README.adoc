# Boof interpreter

This is a Boof interpreter that I wrote for fun. Boof is a derivative of the Turing tarpit esoteric programming language Brainf designed around bit manipulating instead of whole integers.

The Boof language is described here: http://samuelhughes.com/boof/

To compile the program, just run `make`.

Multiple examples are provided with this distribution and may be passed to the interpreter like so:

	./boof examples/hello.boof

When no input name is given, the interpreter will read until the first end of file indicator, then continue reading for data.

If you want to run Brainf programs, you can use the included `brain2bool` program to convert it, like so:

	./brain2bool examples/brain/hello.bf | ./boof
